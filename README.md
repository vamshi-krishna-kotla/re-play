# re-play
A React based framework inspired from my practice in the other repository

The name is an abbreviation : **RE**act-**PLAY**ground

The inspiration is to develop a React based template, framework. There are several frameworks already present but I am doing this to practice creating a generic workflow which can be used by developers as a structure. Just like Angular and Vue, this framework is expected to work with Node based command line prompts.

## short term goals
- template creation to generate React based application
- expose terminal (cmd) commands to add/(edit?)/delete components and routes from the application
- enable optional routing and SSR features

## long term goals
- default service injection where single import statement can work for all components under the imported umbrella
- meta data (decorator based) identity like component name and expected props etc.
- an Angular like structure but a React like workflow
